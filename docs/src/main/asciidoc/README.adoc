== Building

==== Build requirements for Vault

Spring Cloud Vault Config requires SSL certificates and a running
Vault instance listening on `localhost:8200`. Certificates and the Vault
setup are scripted, the scripts are located in `src/test/bash`.

The following scripts need to be run prior to building the project for the tests to pass.
$ ./src/test/bash/install_vault.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh
